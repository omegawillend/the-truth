<h3 id="start">Think and answer a few questions</h3>

<ul> 
<li>Why people in Russia have lost:</li>
 <ul>
   <li>free, independent TV</li>
   <li>access to social media</li>
   <li>access to worldwide news services</li>
   <li>freedom of speech</li>
 </ul>

<li>Why are the FSB and Notional Guard arresting people for peaceful protests against war?</li>

<li>Why didn't anyone from opposition remain free?</li>

<li>Why the quality of life in Ukraine so different from Russian?</li>
</ul>

<p class="resp"> 
The answer is simple: the Russian government, headed by V.V. Putin distorts 
the facts about the real military situation in Ukraine by blocking ALL foreign 
and opposition media on the territory of the Russian Federation. Robbery of the 
ordinary population of Russia, the military-political elite builds palaces for 
themselves and buys yachts, eating even the MILITARY industry, on which they 
often like to speculate. Democracy and freedom of speech are unheard of by the 
Russian people; and many Russian soldiers are surprised at the quality of life 
even in the small regional centers of Ukraine. 
<h3 id="facts">Putin's Lies</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Ukraine is under nazi power!</li>
   <p class="resp">there is no nazis in Ukraine. Even Ukraine's president is a Jew!</p>
  
 <li>There are people waiting for russian troops to make them free</li>
   <p class="resp">bullshit, all people are protesting and asking FR to leave them alone</p>
  
 <li>It's not a war, only special operation</li>
  <p class="resp">it's a regular WAR, check results</p>

 <li>FR is not attacking civilians</li>
  <p class="resp">FR is killing innocent people, kids. Rapes and shooting to regular people is a common thing.</p>
 <li>FR is treatened by expanding NATO, so had to react</li>
  <p class="resp">NATO is a DEFENCE alliance. It can NOT attack anyone. The only reason NATO still exists is FR agression.</p>
    
 <li>FR is helping people in "freed" areas</li>
  <p class="resp">FR soldiers are stealing everything from people, including food,and FR is blocking any humanitarian help and deliveries</p>

 <li>FR agreed on evacuation for civilians</li>
  <p class="resp">every time FR was shooting to evacuating civilians, they were forced to stay back</p>

 <li>It's a war with NATO</li>
  <p class="resp">it's not. There is no single NATO soldier attacking FR, and NATO doesn't want to attack FR</p>
  
 <li>Whole world is sanctioning FR because of russophobia</li>
  <p class="resp">Bullshit. Sanctions are because of FR's agression and targeting civilians, to stop war</p>
    
 <li> FR solders are a heroes</li>
  <p class="resp">They are not. They kill the kids, people during shopping. They are raping, torturing and 
  killing innocent people, stealing everything they can - jewelery, computers even carpets!</p>

 <li> All those images and movies are prepared for propaganda with actors</li>
   <p class="resp">They are not. Scenes from Bucha's extermination of civilians are 100% true and confirmed by many independent sources. <br />
   All manipulation can be easily detected, as it's happening with most of Kadyrow's pictures/movies (they are pretending
   to be on Ukraine and fighting), or with many other FR propaganda examples. </p>

<h3 id="letter">Letter from Russian woman</h3>

  <div class="letter">
     Dear compatriots, Russians! <br /><br />
     On February 24, 2022, our country attacked a neighboring sovereign state and unleashed a fratricidal war with the closest nation to us - the Ukrainian people. 
     Putin's propaganda lies openly to you about the goals and deliberately hides the facts of this terrible “spec. operations”. <br /><br />
     The cities of Kharkov, Mariupol, and the suburbs of Kyiv are completely destroyed by bombing. Civilians, including children, are killed every day as 
     our army deliberately strikes at high-rise buildings, schools, kindergartens, and other non-military facilities. According to the UN, four million Ukrainians 
     are now refugees in neighboring countries. And of those who have remained in the country, ten million have left their homes and must live in shelters, 
     and even these shelters are bombarded with rockets and bombs. This is the biggest migration crisis since the Great Patriotic War! It's hard to believe, 
     but these are facts that you can find on any news site outside of Russia. <br /><br />
     In Russia, there is no longer honest and objective information, the Kremlin and 
     all the state. channels, including Channel One, lie to you, and sources independent of the Kremlin are blocked. If you know someone who has relatives, 
     friends or just close people living in Ukraine or serving in the Russian army - talk to them, ask what they know. If you have relatives or friends in 
     Ukraine or have conscripts, contract soldiers or professional military personnel of the Russian army in your family and you know first-hand 
     information - please share it with your friends. <br /><br />
     Today, without a VPN, it is simply impossible to access independent news in Russia. Therefore, you are the only source of truthful information. 
     The Russians must know the truth, they must understand that power in the country has been seized by a gang of war criminals. Putin's strategy to 
     seize Ukraine in three or four days completely failed because he was not ready for such resistance. All Ukraine stood up to defend their Fatherland. 
     The Russian army, demoralized and mired in corruption, is completely unprepared to fight: our soldiers are cannon fodder. They are thrown like firewood 
     into a furnace - without pity and regret. <br /><br />
